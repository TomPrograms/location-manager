> Example: Create circumference of 50km around 10 Downing Street and check if Buckingham Place falls within the circumference.

```js
await LocationManager.addCircumference({
  centre: new LM.Address("10 Downing Street, London"),
  range: 50
});

const isInRange = await LocationManager.checkInRange(
  new LM.Address("Buckingham Palace, London")
);
```

## Inspiration

We at Shopolivery needed a way to manage to manage the service area of the Shopolivery service; the Shopolivery service isn't available in all locations, so we needed a convenient, robust library to verify whether user locations of all types (such as postcodes and addresses) where within irregular, defined-by-us service areas, so we created location manager. Location manager helps check whether physical locations are within defined areas such as circumferences and bounds.
